Description:
The queue is an essential structure for storing data in computer science. While not everyone might recognize the name, anyone who has ordered food at a restaurant is familiar with the first in, first out format. Our app intends to utilize this format in the form of a to-do-list app. Users first add all the tasks they wish to accomplish for the day, and then queue them in order of importance. Following the data structure, users then complete one task at a time in descending order of importance with the following task appearing each time the current one is marked as completed.
This app would be particularly useful in an academic setting as it is incorporates the most effective strategy for completing homework assignments: starting with the most important tasks before completing the less important ones. For this reason, it would be marketed towards students, particularly those who might struggle to effectively organize their time.

Vision Statement:
Budgeting usersâ€™ time to complete daily tasks in the most logical and time efficient manner possible.

Motivation:
Helping students like us prioritize school, work, and daily tasks to have the best outcome possible.

Risks:
If students believe in our product, and it ineffectively budgets a lot of time, our users will be unhappy. Additionally, depending on our platform we could have problems linking a database and making the actual program (iOS and Android). Also, security?

Risk Mitigation Plan:
Not failing? Being extremely RADICAL! Designing and implementing the product in an iterative and modular way so that failing components can be fixed quickly and effectively.
